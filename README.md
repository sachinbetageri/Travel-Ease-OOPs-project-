Travel Ease is a console-based application developed in C++ to simplify trip planning by providing comprehensive functionalities for both users and admins. Users can seamlessly book transportation and hotel accommodations, manage their bookings, process payments, and update their profiles through an interactive interface. Admins have the capability to update pricing for hotel rooms and transportation services, ensuring the system remains up-to-date and relevant. The project leverages object-oriented programming principles, with a focus on code reliability, maintainability, and scalability through thorough exception handling.

This application demonstrates the power of modular design and robust exception handling in creating reliable software solutions. While the current version is console-based, future enhancements could include integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) and database support for persistent data storage, further enhancing the functionality and user experience of Travel Ease.
